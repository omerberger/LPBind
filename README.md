# LPBind
This was a preliminary test for binding an Xcode Generated static lib which acts as a mediator.
The static lib is exposing API for communicating with the Swift based frameworks and we used 'sharpie tool' for generating C# code into Xamarin. Then we also added the Swift Frameworks to the Xamarin Project.
